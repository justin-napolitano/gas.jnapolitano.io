Considering this change, the city's cast iron replacement program, and the city's 2019 record/GIS clean-up project the city believes the values reported in Part B to be accurate, though different from prior years.

This improvement resulted in a higher number of above ground leaks recorded in 2019 than in previous years. The number of reported EFVs in the system at the end of the year is lower in 2019 than in 2018 due to the reporting range. The 2019 report contains the number of EFVs installed in 2017 and beyond. Supplemental: Provided a revised number for the number of reported EFVs in the system at the end of the year. The revised number includes all EFVs installed regardless of the year they were installed. Updated leaks in Part C.

Leak record data management was improved in 2019. This improvement resulted in a higher number of above ground leaks recorded in 2019 than in previous years. The number of reported EFVs in the system at the end of the year is lower in 2019 than in 2018 due to the reporting range. The 2019 report contains the number of EFVs installed in 2017 and beyond.

WLNG operates on daily basis of 55-58 psi with MAOP of 67 psi for the system. (2)WLNG's supplier of natural gas is Centerpoint Energy Services with the gas being taken at Gulf South Pipeline meter station. The transportation of the gas is by Southeast Gas Transmission along a 6.5 mile 8"" steel gas pipeline. (3)The odorization of the gas is done by Southeast Gas with a system by King Tool 1-B-with an OD 6 5/8"" holding 2.2 gallons of odorant with an odorant reserve tank on site that contains 55 gallons. It's maximum capacity is 150,000 SCFH. Odorator used in field by WLNG is a Heath Consultant odorator that is one of the newest and is called a New Style Odorator. Any abnormal readings over 1.00 are discussed with Southeast Gas Transmission and adjustments are made by them on injection levels. (4)Operation & Maintenance with Emergencies Procedural Manual updated for the system in March 2018. (5)Map of entire system is available for anyone to examine. Detailed data is given to the 2 County Supervisors within the system. (6)Detailed monthly patrolling reports are completed and filed by the quarter. Gauges throughout system checked on meter reading days and sampled on patrolling days. (7)Valve maintenance per Key valves checked on 12 months basis, no later than 15 months. Key valves checked in November 2019. Also, all 2"" valves within main system were checked on December 3, 2018 and will be checked again in 2020. Large meters were checked for correct calibration in May 2019 and will be checked again in 2021. (8)In July 2017 entire system had leak survey. There were only 4 #3 leaks found. All were repaired, tightened, or replaced by August 3, 2017. Business Districts (high traffic areas) with high usage gas were checked on May 20 and May 31, 2019. Twenty Eight (28%) of entire system was leak surveyed on July 9 and July 11, 2019. (9)Annual Report filed each year on system with PHMSA. (10)Operator of system meets all requirements for CEU hours and was re-certified in September 2017 covering him for 3 years till September 2020. Periodic Review of Operator personnel has indicated that operations ran well in 2019. (11)On November 18, 2019 corrosion was sampled throughout system. Sample looked ok and no abnormal findings for pitting, cracking, chipping, or scaling were found per risers checked. The other corrosion area we examine is the 2 key valves inside of Southeast Gas Transmission regulator station. All looked ok in this area in 2019 when touch up painting was completed. (12)Main public awareness campaigns are mail outs to customers and door to door hand outs throughout district. April 2019 ""NOSE KNOWS"" campaign was mailed and delivered to non-customers along the main. ""Plan Ahead"" was sent to customers in November 2019 on billing statements. ""Public Information"" letter will be delivered and signed for with large gas users in January 2020. GOAL survey was done in December 2018 and will probably be set up for December 2020.

However, we felt actions were necessary. The actions taken were 1. researched for gaps in missing, inaccurate, or incomplete records. 2. have increased the odorant consumption to 1# per mmcf during the month of January 2020. 3. replaced over 5% of our largest commercial meters. and 4. in the process of evaluating residential gas meters and verifying accurate pressures on those gas meters. During review of to date, 2020 loss and unaccounted gas, a more acceptable percentage rate is present. After reviewing the amount of stop gas meters replaced during the period of 2019 loss gas, I have come to the conclusion that this was the cause.
