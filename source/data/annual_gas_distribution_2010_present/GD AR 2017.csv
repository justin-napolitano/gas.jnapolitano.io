Within one year from installation many failures to transmit accurate readings were recorded; in fact so many that Master Meter believed the best solution was to accept responsibility and made an allowance to have modules in our inventory for replacement as needed. Adamsville Gas through our own audit has determined that the replacement modules continued to have the same failure rate as the originals. After much conversation Master Meter has made manufacturing changes to the placement of the magnet believing this change will resolve the issues Adamsville Gas has experienced with failure to transmit accurate readings. Adamsville is expecting their first delivery of the corrected modules in March 2018 with installation to begin immediately. Adamsville Gas is experiencing a larger percentage loss for the disposition of Natural Gas that can be directly attributed to issues related to accurate meter readings.,Paul Plunk,operator,(731) 632-4214,(731) 632-1980,pplunk@cityofadamsville.com,SUPPLEMENTAL,3/7/2018,10/11/2018,7100.1-1 (Rev. 01-2017)

Plant Accounting does not retire mains and services based on the year the facility was installed. Therefore, the miles of main and number of services installed in the current year were added to the current decade. The retired miles of main and number of services are deducted from the unknown column on the report. In 2017, SCE&G began a project to populate the decade installed GIS attribute for all main segments. This project used known data and subject matter expert experience to populate all possible main segments with a decade of installation, which would allow SCE&G to begin using GIS main mileages to complete the Distribution Annual Report. Upon completion of this project, using GIS to report gas main mileages is now felt to be more accurate than Plant Accounting data and, beginning with the 2017 Distribution Annual Report, will become the official data source for miles of main. The official data source for the number of service lines will remain Plant Accounting in the 2017 Distribution Annual Report. A project was completed in 2017 that incorporates services lines and attributes into the company GIS, though a small number of services still require additional information and service card creation before being entered into GIS. This effort will continue into 2018 and, until these final cleanup activities are completed, Plant Accounting is felt to be the most accurate and complete data source for service quantities.",Jason Rabon,Gas Distribution Engineer,(803)217-7060,,jason.rabon@scana.com,INITIAL,3/14/2018,3/14/2018,7100.1-1 (Rev. 01-2017)

WLNG continues to operate on daily basis of 55-58 psi with a MAOP of 67 psi for the system. (2) Main change in 2017 was WLNG's supplier of gas. In October of 2017 Centerpoint Energy Services became WLNG's source of natural gas through meter station of Gulf South Pipeline. The transporter of the gas is Southeast Gas Transmission, which covers only 6.5 miles now rather than the 34.5 miles of Denbury Resources. Also, a new odorization system was put in at the Gulf South Pipeline gas take. (3) Odorization test are taken monrhly in our field wide system by WLNG. Any abnormal readings are talked over with Southeast Gas. Since October 2017, WLNG has noticed that the mercaptan smell of new system is different and that readings tend to be a little higher than the old odorization system. (4) Detailed monthly reports per patrolling. Gauges throughout system checked on meter reading days and sampled on patrolling days. (5) Valve maintenance per Key Valves checked on 12 month basis, no later than 15 months. Key Valves checked in November 2017. All valves within the 2"" main were checked in November 2016. Plan to check all valves in system during November 2018. Large meters (4 of them) were checked in July 2017 for correct calibration by Mid-South Meter & Regulator. (6) In July 2017 entire system checked for leak survey and only 4 #3 leaks were found. Those were repaired; tightened; and re-checked for leaks on August 3, 2017. High traffic areas will be checked in April 2018. (7) Operator of system meets all requirements for CEU hours and was re-certified in September 2017 covering him for 3 years till September 2020. (8) Our public awareness is a door to door delivery of our pipeline safety to customers and non-customers. If anyone is near the 30.33 miles of main they get our public awareness campaign information. Public Awareness campaigns were completed in January 2017; April 2017 and September 2017. Our 2 District Supervisors do a good job of keeping in touch. Loyd Star Volunteer Fire Department is in same complex area as our largest customer (Loyd Star School). We keep the school informed on all gas situations. (9) WLNG keeps up to date information on the 2 employees of the system for drug and alcohol testing requirements. (10) The main equipment items used for day to day operations (Sur-Lock Locator; New Style Odorator; and Leak Detector-all Heath Equipment products) were re-calibrated by Heath on June 29, 2017. WLNG has no Regulator Station that they operate.",D. Steven Smith,Office Superintendent,(601) 833-8355,(601) 833-8355,dstevensmith20@hughes.net,INITIAL,3/19/2018,3/19/2018,7100.1-1 (Rev. 01-2017)
