However, this number is due to a posting lag in our mapping system. We have validated that all known Cast Iron mains in our systems were replaced in 2018. Also, due to data updates through our records integrity initiative, CenterPoint Energy-Arkla saw an increase to the install mileage in the legacy decades, and a subsequent decrease in the unknown category. As this initiative updated our GIS mapping, it moved unknown decade mileage from that category to the appropriate decade. 7/11/2019 - After a review of the data submission for the 2018 DOT report, it was determined that the data submitted did not follow the DOT definitions for Part D.

Inclusion of these customers' usage presents a more accurate representation of the unaccounted for percentage and is in line with proposed PHMSA modifications to this calculation. - Beginning in 2017, New York State's Public Service Commission revised the methodology and criteria for Con Edison's reporting of ""One Call Tickets"" (Excavation Tickets). The revised methodology results in a smaller geographic area being captured by Con Edison for reporting purposes and a concomitant decline in the reported ""Number of Excavation Tickets"" as compared to 2016 and prior years.",Michele Loo,,(718)839-1527,,loomi@coned.com,INITIAL,3/14/2019,3/14/2019,7100.1-1 (Rev. 10-2018)

However, this number is due to a posting lag in our mapping system. We have validated that all known Cast Iron mains in our systems were replaced in 2018. Also, due to data updates through our records integrity initiative, CenterPoint Energy-Entex saw an increase to the install mileage in the legacy decades, and a subsequent decrease in the unknown category. As this initiative updated our GIS mapping, it moved unknown decade mileage from that category to the appropriate decade. 7/11/2019 - After a review of the data submission for the 2018 DOT report, it was determined that the data submitted did not follow the DOT definitions for Part D.

Fairhope utilities just completed a 100% leakage survey to ensure the issue is not in any way tied to leaks. Our intention is to be completely transparent and report as accurately as we can. Therefore this number must be reflected in our report but DOES NOT give indication our Natural Gas system has a unaccounted for gas loss due to leaks.,John Boyett,Compliance Manager,(251)928-8003,,wes.boyett@fairhopeal.gov,INITIAL,3/14/2019,3/14/2019,7100.1-1 (Rev. 10-2018)

The numbers, on the supplemental annual report, trend similar to previous years and reflect recent initiatives by the Authority to improve the overall leak program. The original reports numbers were gathered from a report that is generated from an Authority owned database that tracks all gas leaks. It was determined that the database report was not pulling data from additional part of system locations (meter set, riser, and etc.) relating to service lines. After completing a paper audit of all reportable gas leaks, it was determined the report from the database needed to be revised.",Chris Nolen,operator,(803) 323-5340,(803) 329-4955,chris.nolen@ycnga.com,SUPPLEMENTAL,3/14/2019,11/12/2019,7100.1-1 (Rev. 10-2018)

Because of this, there is more up to date information on material type reported on these service lines. This enhancement reflects a significant change in the services reported, in Part B.1., from the 2017 annual report to the 2018 report. Atmos Energy Mid-Tex records mapping activity resulted in an inventory of 112,549 total steel services (includes all steel no. of services categories) and 397,841 'OTHER' services whose material type was not reflected on a record or did not have a record. In previous years Atmos Energy Mid-Tex has not reported any service line assets in the ""OTHER"" category. The same records mapping activity resulted in a change in the overall number of services reported. In 2017 Atmos Energy Mid-Tex reported 1,455,352 service lines total and in 2018 we are reporting 1,734,004 service lines total.",Kelee Lusk,Compliance Supervisor,(817)207-2850,,kelee.lusk@atmosenergy.com,INITIAL,3/15/2019,3/15/2019,7100.1-1 (Rev. 10-2018)

We began investigating our gas loss and have discovered numerous meters that were not registering any gas use at all. We began the replacement at the end of last year and have ordered 250 meters to complete the replacement. In addition we discovered there was an issue with the wholesale meter. The company we purchase gas from was reporting more gas sold to us than what we were actually purchasing. This has been corrected and the amount of gas being purchased from our provider is now correct.
