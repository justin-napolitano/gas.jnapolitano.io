Back in 2006, 9 miles of galvanized main was split out of the steel category and put into “Other” with a hand written “GALV”. In 2009 the miles had been added back to protected steel. In 2012 after 3 miles of galvanized was replaced by PE, the remainder 6 miles was put back into the “other” category. This galvanized steel main is coated and cathodically protected, so I am adding it back where it belongs in the “protected steel” category. I removed 4 service leaks and 2 main leaks from the totals due to the following (rev 10-11-2018) PHMSA F 7100.1-1 instructions: “A “leak” is defined as an unintentional escape of gas from the pipeline.

Inclusion of these customers' usage presents a more accurate representation of the unaccounted for percentage and is in line with proposed PHMSA modifications to this calculation. - Beginning in 2017, New York State's Public Service Commission revised the methodology and criteria for Con Edison's reporting of ""One Call Tickets""(Excavation Tickets). The revised methodology results in a smaller geographic area being captured by Con Edison for reporting purposes and a concomitant decline in the reported ""Number of Excavation Tickets"" as compared to 2016 and prior years.",Mer Manahan,,(718)839-8287,,manahanm@coned.com,INITIAL,3/11/2021,3/11/2021,7100.1-1 (Rev. 10-2018)

It has been determined by maps and actual inspection of the Alabama side of the Florala Utilities gas system that only approx. 17 miles of main exist in Alabama. The four leak investigations perform in 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019 also reflect this. During further investigation it was determined the total number of services reflected for Alabama also included the Florida customers of the Florala Utilities Natural gas as well as abandoned facilities, which have been removed from this report. Alabama should only reflect 710 steel 1” or less service in system and 84 Plastic PE 1” or less.

First, there was a malfunction with our BIG meter at Riceland. It stopped working during their busiest drying season and we did not catch it until a month later. We did our best to calculate the gas but had no actual numbers to be absolutely sure. Second, we have been in the process of revamping our billing system, looking into going totally online. During this we discovered the meters in our system that are supposed to have additional pressure factors calculated on their usage were not calculating correctly. We have been working with our billing techs to get that fixed and thought we had it but we failed to calculate for temperature so we are re-vamping that now. We are also looking into switching the date we do our downloads so it will coincide with the date our gas supplier is downloading to ensure the most accuracy. Third, we had a leak on our main that we had been searching to find for a while and we finally located it and got it fixed. Fourth, we had a line hit during excavation to repair a water line leak, we stopped and fixed the gas leak first but still had some loss. Lastly, we are talking to one of our gas companies about an all encompassing survey of our meters to check for accuracy and leaks. We feel that all of this combined caused our unaccounted number to jump and we have already taken steps to get that back down and have further steps planned.",Trilby Shelman,Utilities Asst.,(870) 255-4521,(870) 255-3404,hazengas@cityofhazen.org,INITIAL,2/19/2021,2/19/2021,7100.1-1 (Rev. 10-2018)

This way we could track down problem areas and solve in a timely manner. In receiving these reports we recognized the ""No. of Services"" we have been reporting on the DOT were higher than the services we have. We started with the number that James Beamon had on his last DOT report before his death. To that number we have been adding services and subtracting what was killed. The monthly reports from Utility Management let us know the most correct number of services, which is reflected on this report. After reviewing the PHMSA's definitions for leak classifications, we adjusted the classification numbers. Shifted No. of services to correct column after recognizing a new 2020-2029 column was on the report.",Dane Lovell,Operator,(601)631-3775,(601) 801-3624,wandag@vicksburg.org,SUPPLEMENTAL,3/10/2021,4/7/2021,7100.1-1 (Rev. 10-2018)

This appears to be high but is largely due to the supplier charging for at least a minimum of one DTH per day. Due to our small number of services our system does not use that much many days during the summer months which results in an abnormally high unaccounted for gas. For example during the summer months of June-Sept our unaccounted for gas percent ranged from 13% in June to a high of 36% in August. In winter months it is much lower.,Dan Kolterman,operator,(785) 948-2310,,cityclerk@jbntelco.com,INITIAL,2/4/2021,2/4/2021,7100.1-1 (Rev. 10-2018)

WLNG operates on daily basis of 55-58 psi with MAOP of 67 psi for the system. (2)WLNG's supplier of natural gas is Symetry a division of Centerpoint Energy Services (CES) with the gas being taken at Gulf South Pipeline meter station. The transportation of the gas from October 2017 to November of 2020 was Southeast Gas Transmission. It runs along a 6.5 mile 8"" steel gas pipeline. In December of 2020 the transporter became Mississippi Natural, Inc with headquarters in Collierville, TN, The same operations mgr for Southeast Gas will be retained by Mississippi Natural. (3)Odorization of the gas will continue by Mississippi Natural with the same system used. This will be a King Tool 1-B with an OD 6 5/8"" holding 2.2 gallons of odorant with an odorant reserve tank on site that contains 55 gallons. It's maximum capacity is 150,000 SCFH. The odorator used by WLNG within the system is a Heath Consultant odorator that is one of the newest and is called a New Style Odorator. Any abnormal readings over 1.00 will be discussed with Mississippi Natural, Inc and adjustments if needed will be made by them at the injection site. (4)Operation & Maintenance with Emergencies Procedural Manual updated for the system in March of 2018. (5) Map of entire system is available for anyone to examine, Detailed data is given to 2 Supervisors within the system. (6)Detailed monthly patrolling reports are compiled and filed by quarter. Gauges throughout the system are checked on meter reading days and sampled on patrolling days. (7)Valve maintenance per Key Valves checked on 12 months no later than 15 months. Key Valves were checked in October 2020. Also, all 2"" valves within the main system checked during October 2020. Large meters were checked for correct calibration in May 2019 and will be checked again in 2021. (8)In July 2017 entire system system had leak survey. There were only 4 #3 leaks found. All were repaired, tightened, or replaced by August 3, 2017. Business Districts (high traffic areas) with high usage gas were checked on May 22, 2020. 20% of entire system was leak surveyed from July 23-31, 2020. (9)Annual Reports filed each year on system with PHMSA. (10)Operator of system meets all requirements for CEU hours and was re-certified in November 2020 covering him till November of 2023. Periodic Review of Operator Personnel has indicated that operations ran well in 2020, even though Covid-19 issue was of high priority. (11)On December 16, 2020 corrosion control was sampled throughout the system. Sample looked ok and no abnormal findings for pitting, cracking, chipping, or scaling were found per risers checked. The other corrosion area area we examine is the 2 Key Valves inside Mississippi Natural, Inc regulator station. All looked ok in this area as in 2020 when touch up painting was completed. (12)Main Public Awareness campaigns were restricted to mail-outs to customers and non-customers per the Covid-19 issue. We delivered per signature to large volumn users on January 27, 2020 a message on ""Public Awareness"" concerning natural gas. Information was delivered to Loyd Star Fire Dept on March 13, 2020 per signature. Public information concerning natural gas was sent to customers and non-customers on May 20 and May 23, 2020. Information delivered to Public Officials (Sheriff's representative and Supervisors) on July 27, 2020 per signature. Information sent to customers and non-customers on December 28, 2020. GOAL SURVEY completed in December 2018. We are every 4 years with them, but may change to 2 to 3 years in the future.
